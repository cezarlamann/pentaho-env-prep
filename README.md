# Pentaho BI Server CE Environment Preparation Scripts 

The goal of this project is to create one or more scripts to automate Pentaho BI Server setups on cloud/on-premises servers where docker is not available. Softwares involved: Pentaho BI Server CE 6, PostgreSQL 9.4, Java 8 (OpenJDK 8) and inherited dependencies

Most of this work is based on, and harness some scripts from SeraSoft docker-pentaho repository (https://github.com/SeraSoft/docker-pentaho) which is cloned by me too.

## How it works?

You must have a broadband connection, since the size of all softwares involved in this project is around 1.5 Gb.
